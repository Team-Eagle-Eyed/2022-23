## Team 8825's swerve drive code for the 2022-2023 school year
### Modified from team 3512's [modified version](https://github.com/frc3512/swervebot-2022) of team 364's [BaseFalconSwerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve) project to utilize __NEO motors__

Therefore, their [instructions](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve#setting-constants) on modifiying the constants to fit your robot will also work on this repo as well.

### Configurations
- Works with a swerve drive with __NEO brushless motors__, __Spark Max motor controllers__, __CTRE CANCoders__, and __CTRE Pigeon 2.0 IMU__.
- Drive and steer ratios are configured for the __SDS MK4 L2 modules__, but can be easily be adapted to other modules. Remember to invert your turn motor on MK4Is.
